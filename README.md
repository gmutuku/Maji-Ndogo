# **Restoring the Lifeblood of Maji Ndogo**

## **Introduction**
At the heart of this project lies a **water crisis** affecting the fictitious country of **Maji Ndogo**. This initiative explores the complexities of leveraging SQL to address pressing challenges with data, extracting valuable insights that prompt deeper thinking and action.

## **Acknowledgments**
This project was undertaken in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the [ALX + Explore AI Academy's Data Science curriculum](https://www.explore.ai/learn/courses/data-science). 

## **Project Overview**
This project unfolds in four distinct parts, each building upon the previous one in both SQL syntax complexity and depth of analysis. Together, they provide a comprehensive framework for approaching and solving problems using data.

## **Part 1: Beginning Our Data-Driven Journey in Maji Ndogo**
In the first part of the project, we explore Maji Ndogo's extensive database, which contains 60,000 records across various tables. Through basic queries, we will familiarize ourselves with the content of each table while also refining the data using Data Manipulation Language (DML).

### **Objectives**
By the end of this section, participants should be able to:
- **Create** and **navigate** a new database effectively.
- **Construct** and **modify** basic queries.
- **Utilize operators** to create conditional filters.
- **Filter data** using multiple criteria through operator understanding.
- **Employ DML** while being aware of the associated risks when changing a database.

## **Part 2: Clustering Data to Unveil Maji Ndogo's Water Crisis**
In this second part, we prepare for an in-depth analytical examination of Maji Ndogo's water situation. We will harness a variety of SQL functions, including advanced window functions, to extract meaningful insights from the data tables.

### **Objectives**
By the end of this section, participants should be able to:
- Demonstrate a solid understanding of **SQL functions**.
- Utilize **SQL window functions** effectively.
- **Clean and analyze** data using various functions.
- Apply data **aggregation techniques**.

## **Part 3: Weaving the Data Threads of Maji Ndogo's Narrative**
In the third part of the project, we will gather data from multiple tables and conduct statistical analyses to assess the implications of an audit report that cross-references a random sample of records.

### **Objectives**
By the end of this section, participants should be able to:
- **Retrieve data** from multiple sources seamlessly.
- Understand the challenges associated with **joining diverse data sources**.

## **Part 4: Charting the Course for Maji Ndogo's Water Future**
In the final part of the project, we will synthesize our data analysis using the complete suite of SQL tools. This section aims to draw final insights, classify water sources, and prepare the relevant data for Maji Ndogo's engineering teams and stakeholders.

### **Objectives**
By the end of this section, participants should be able to:
- Combine filters, aggregations, functions, and joins in data analysis.
- Understand the complexities involved in solving real-world problems using SQL.
- Effectively use **subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**, and **views**.
